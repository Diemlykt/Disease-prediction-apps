## üöÄ Features

- **Clinical Data Prediction**: Upload structured clinical information (CSV) to predict Alzheimer's diagnosis.
- **Image-Based Stage Classification**: Upload MRI images to predict the stage of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (e.g., Non-Demented, Very Mild, Mild, Moderate).
- **Dual Upload Modes**:
  - Clinical data upload via CSV file.
  - Medical image upload via PNG/JPG.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores both clinical records and MRI images (via GridFS).
- **Prediction Result Display**: Presents prediction outputs clearly within the web UI.
- **FastAPI RESTful API**: A scalable backend to process predictions.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: A user-friendly interface to interact with prediction modules.
- **PDF Report Generation** *(optional feature)*: Export results for documentation or patient records.
- **Render Deployment**: Full deployment with uptime maintenance using CRON job-based pings.
